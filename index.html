<h1>Tech Stacker</h1>
<p>Tech Stacker gives you a fully functional tech stack with many optional add-on components and services.  It is a great base for your web and/or mobile applications.</p>

<p>Tech Stacker aims to reduce the work required to start a new project or to develop application features and integrating third-party services.</p>

<p>We invite all code authors to contribute fully functional example components of their work to Tech Stacker to help us see your project working with a real-life application.</p>

<h2>Additional Info</h2>
